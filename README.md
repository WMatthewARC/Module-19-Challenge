# Module-19-Challenge | Supervised Machine Learning

In this assignment, we will be building a machine learning model that attempts to predict whether a loan will be approved or not.


We will be using this data to create machine learning models to classify the risk level of given loans. Specifically, we will be comparing the Logistic Regression model and Random Forest Classifier model.


Commented in the notebook but I will add here as well; I believe Random Forest Classifier model has a better chance at succeeding just because it has more modules in here. The other one also takes a bit longer to run and I'm not as confident in the Logistic Regression model.

:brain:The Random Forest Classifier model wins with a higher score for both the Training Score and Testing Score.
Logistic Regression model is clsoe maybe another set of data if could be better but takes to longer to run.


Thanks -
